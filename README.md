# Decentralized Lending Platform

## Project Description

The Decentralized Lending Platform is a smart contract-based application that allows users to deposit ETH as collateral and borrow against it without needing a traditional financial intermediary. The system runs entirely on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency, security, and accessibility.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to democratize finance by enabling trustless and permissionless lending. We aim to empower users with access to capital while maintaining the security and autonomy provided by blockchain technology.

## Key Features

- 🏦 **Collateralized Lending:** Users can deposit ETH and borrow up to 50% of the deposited value.
- 🔁 **Simple Repayment System:** Borrowers can repay loans directly through the smart contract.
- 🔐 **Secure Withdrawals:** Funds can be withdrawn only if there are no outstanding loans.
- ⚖️ **Fully On-Chain Logic:** All lending, borrowing, and repayment logic is executed through smart contracts.

## Future Scope

- 📈 **Dynamic Interest Rates:** Implement variable rates based on utilization ratio.
- 💱 **Token-Based Lending:** Expand beyond ETH to support ERC-20 tokens.
- 🧠 **Credit Scoring:** Introduce on-chain reputation oracles for personalized borrowing limits.
- 🌍 **Cross-Chain Integration:** Extend functionality to other blockchains through bridges.
- 🛠️ **Governance System:** Allow community-driven proposals and upgrades via DAO.
